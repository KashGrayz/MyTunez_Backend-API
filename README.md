# MyTunez_Backend-API

The Music Library Backend REST API project is the first part of your first full stack application project! Your REST API will serve endpoints accessible through HTTP requests over the internet allowing external applications to interact with your application. You will be connecting your Music Library frontend application to this API upon completion of the project.
